wikicategories contains a whole bunch of data files and a whole bunch of scripts and programs to process them. 

HOW TO USE:
skos_categories_en.nt is a giant text file from dbpedia.org containing a list of various relationships between all categories in the English wikipedia. 
article_categories_en.nt is a text file from dbpedia.org with simple processing by me that contains a list of articles with their categories. 

WARNING: Because they operate on large files, many of these programs take a lot of execution time (3-5 minutes on a fast server). Some load ~1-2GB text 
files into memory. 

RUN THE PROGRAMS IN THIS ORDER!!!

skos_parser.sh:
	- reads skos_categories_en.nt
	- generates categories_parsed.txt [the skos file with a lot of fluff removed]

supercat_lookup_all_caching (a C++ program, compile with -std=c++11 -O2):
	- reads categories_parsed.txt
	- writes to stdout (you should redirect to CategoriesSupercats.txt)

	- Gives the number of hops between each category and each of the 23 wikipedia top-level categories (I refer to these as supercats). Multiple breadth-first searches are used (one for each of the 23 categories) and a 24th one to print them all out. 

article_categories_parser.sh
	- reads article_categories_en.nt
	- generates ArticleCategories.txt [lot of fluff removed]


article_supercats (C++ program, compile with -std=c++11 -O2):
	- reads ArticleCategories.txt and CategoriesSupercats.txt
	- generates ArticlesSupercats.txt

sort_articles_supercats.sh:
	- reads and writes ArticlesSupercats.txt
	- sorts that file using the order expected by lookup_article.pl

lookup_article.pl:
	- reads ArticlesSupercats.txt
	- uses a fast binary search (dependent on the file previously having been sorted by sort_articles_supercats.sh) to lookup the desired article. 

	- Usage: ./lookup_article.pl Anarchism
